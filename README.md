# Story Maps Workshop ~ Smith College Spatial Analysis Lab ~ Undesign Researchfest, 3/3/17

In this workshop, we will make a Story Map - a web map that integrates text, pictures, and other digital media - to explore the lingering effect of redlining on the social landscape of Holyoke and Chicopee.

## Data layers available to you:
1. **FreshProduceGroceries** - grocery stores in Chicopee that sell fresh produce
2. **FreshProduceWalkingBuffers** - areas in Chicopee within 1 mile walking distance to a grocery store selling fresh produce
3. **IsolatedByHighway** - areas in Chicopee with limited pedestrain access to the rest of the city due to two interstate highways
4. **HampdenCountyCensusData** - demographic data from the 2015 American Community Survey for census block groups in Hampden County. Fields include:
  *Population: total population of each census block
  *Citizen: number of US Citizens per census block
  *NonCitizen: number of non-citizens
  *Income: per capita income
  *NonHisp: number of persons of any race not identifying as Hispanic or Latino
  *Hispanic: number of persons of any race identifying as Hispanic or Latino
  *White: white population
  *Black: black population
  *AIAN: American Indian & Alaska Native population
  *Asian: Asian population
  *Other: number of people identifying with another race (not one of the census categories)
  *TwoOrMore: number of people identifying as two or more races
5. **RedlineMaps** - redlined (and yellow, blue, and greenlined) areas. The Field "Grade" refers to the grading given by the HOLC assessors in the '30s. A is best - these areas are green on the original maps - followed by B/blue, C/Yellow, and D/red.
